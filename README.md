### About
---
This is a Java-based ecosystem simulator I made in 2013 as a final project for my CS112 class. It was my first attempt at making a program that used any sort of graphics. It's another one of those projects I'd thought I lost forever, so it's getting put up here for good measure.

### Known Issues
---
 - Adding 2501 or more animals into the ecosystem results in a hard lock-up of the program. (That's 1 more animal than the 50x50 grid can handle.)
 - You have to manual enter a number in each creature type, it doesn't auto-fill 0's.
